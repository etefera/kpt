Kpt (pronounced “kept”) is an OSS tool for building declarative workflows
on top of resource configuration.

Its git + YAML architecture means it just works with existing tools,
frameworks, and platforms.

Kpt includes solutions to fetch, display, customize, update, validate, and
apply Kubernetes configuration.

Install via gcloud, homebrew, binaries or source.

We use a pull request workflow on **GitHub**. New users are always welcome!

transform and validate configuration.
