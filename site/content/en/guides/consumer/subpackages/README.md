  Fetch a kpt package with subpackages from a remote git repository and apply its 
  contents to a cluster
---



#### Notice: Subpackages support is available with kpt version v0.34.0+ for [cfg] commands only



This guide walks you through an example to get, view, set and apply contents of an
example kpt package with a [subpackage] in its directory tree.

## Steps

1. [Fetch a remote package](#fetch-a-remote-package)
2. [View the package contents](#view-the-package-contents)
3. [Provide the setter values](#provide-the-setter-values)
4. [Apply the package](#apply-the-package)

## Fetch a remote package

Fetch an example kpt package with [subpackage] using [kpt pkg get].

### get command

```sh
kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt.git/package-examples/wordpress \
wordpress
```

## View the package contents

The primary package artifacts are Kubernetes resource configuration
(e.g. YAML files).

### List package contents in a tree structure

Once you fetch the package onto local list its contents using [tree] command.

```sh
kpt cfg tree wordpress/
```

Output:

```sh
wordpress
├── [Kptfile]  Kptfile wordpress
├── [wordpress-deployment.yaml]  Deployment wordpress
├── [wordpress-deployment.yaml]  Service wordpress
├── [wordpress-deployment.yaml]  PersistentVolumeClaim wp-pv-claim
└── Pkg: mysql
    ├── [Kptfile]  Kptfile mysql
    ├── [mysql-deployment.yaml]  PersistentVolumeClaim mysql-pv-claim
    ├── [mysql-deployment.yaml]  Deployment wordpress-mysql
    └── [mysql-deployment.yaml]  Service wordpress-mysql
```

There are two kpt packages in the output:

1. wordpress
2. mysql

`mysql` package is a [subpackage] of `wordpress` package

Optionally, users may use other commands like [count], [grep], [cat] to
further view and understand the package contents.

### List setters in the package

The fetched package contains [setters]. Invoke [list-setters] command to list
the [setters] recursively in all the packages.

```sh
kpt cfg list-setters wordpress/
```

Output:

```sh
wordpress/
         NAME             VALUE      SET BY   DESCRIPTION   COUNT   REQUIRED
  gcloud.core.project   PROJECT_ID                          3       No
  image                 wordpress                           1       No
  tag                   4.8                                 1       No
  teamname              YOURTEAM                            3       Yes

wordpress/mysql/
         NAME             VALUE      SET BY   DESCRIPTION   COUNT   REQUIRED
  gcloud.core.project   PROJECT_ID                          3       No
  image                 wordpress                           1       No
  tag                   4.8                                 1       No
  teamname              YOURTEAM                            3       Yes
```

You may notice that the [auto-setter] `gcloud.core.project` is already set if you
have `gcloud` configured on your local.

## Provide the setter values

Provide the values for all the [required setters]. By default, [set]
command is performed only on the resource files of provided package and not its
subpackages. `--recurse-subpackages(-R)` can be leveraged to run the command on
subpackages recursively.

```sh
kpt cfg set wordpress/ teamname myteam -R
```

Output:

```sh
wordpress/
set 3 field(s)

wordpress/mysql/
set 3 field(s)
```

## Apply the package

Now that you have configured the package, apply it to the cluster

```sh
kubectl apply -f wordpress/ -R
```

Output:

```sh
service/wordpress-mysql created
persistentvolumeclaim/mysql-pv-claim created
deployment.apps/wordpress-mysql created
service/wordpress created
persistentvolumeclaim/wp-pv-claim created
deployment.apps/wordpress created
```
