## Functions Explained

KRM Config Functions are client-side programs that make it easy to operate on a
package of Kubernetes configuration files. Anyone who wants to automate management
of a configuration can write a function to accomplish the task.

In GitOps workflows, configuration functions read and write configuration files from
a Git repo. Changes to the system authored by humans and mutating functions
are reviewed before being committed to the repo. They can be run locally or as
part of a CI/CD pipeline, or as pre-commit or post-commit steps to validate
configurations before they are applied to a cluster.

KPT offers multiple runtimes for configuration functions to run arbitrary
actions on configuration. By default KPT runs configuration functions in a
[container runtime], but it also provides runtimes for functions packaged as
[executables] or [starlark scripts].

The image below details how a function adds the label `color: pink` to a
package.

Functions can address many types of use cases, including:

- **Configuration Validation:** e.g. Lint Kubernetes resources using `kubeval`.
- **Configuration Generation:** e.g. Generate configuration using `kustomize`.
- **Configuration Transformation:** e.g. Upsert Helm chart configuration to an
  existing package of hydrated helm configs using the latest version of the
  chart.

## Running Functions

Functions may be run either imperatively using the form
`kpt fn run DIR/ --image some-image:version`, or they may be run declaratively
using the form `kpt fn run DIR/`.

Either way, `kpt fn run` will

1. read the package directory `DIR/` as input
2. encapsulate the package resources in a `ResourceList`
3. run the function(s), providing the ResourceList as input
4. write the function(s) output back to the package directory; creating,
   deleting, or updating resources

This repository documents a catalog of functions implementing the
[Configuration Functions Specification][spec].

Implement configuration functions using any toolchain such as the
[Typescript SDK][ts sdk] or [Golang Libraries][go libs].

### Imperative Run

Functions can be run imperatively by specifying the `--image` flag.

**Example:** Locally run the container image
`gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace` against the resources in `.`.

Letâ€™s look at the example of imperatively running a function to set a label
value. The ([label-namespace]) container image contains a program which adds a
label to all Namespace resources provided to it.

Run the function:

```sh
kpt fn run . --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace -- label_name=color label_value=orange
```

Arguments specified after `--` will be provided as input to the function as a
`ConfigMap` containing `data: {label_name: color, label_value: orange}`.  This
is used to parameterize the behavior of the function.

If the package directory `.` is not specified, the source will default to STDIN
and sink will default to STDOUT.

**Example:** This is equivalent to the preceding example

```sh
kpt fn source . |
  kpt fn run --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace -- label_name=color label_value=orange |
  kpt fn sink .
```

The above example commands will:

- read all resources from the package directory `.` to generate input resources
- parse the arguments into a functionConfig field along with input resources
- create a container from the image
- provide the input to the function (container)
- write the output items back to the package directory `.`

### Declarative Run

Functions and their input configuration may be declared in files rather than
directly on the command line. The declarative method will be the most common
way of invoking config functions in production. Functions can be specified
declaratively using the `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation on a
resource serving as the functionConfig.

**Example:** Equivalent to the imperative run example

We can run the same [label-namespace] example declaratively, which means we
make a reusable function configuration resource which contains all information
necessary to run the function, from container image to argument values. Once we
create file with this information we can check it into [VCS] and run the
function in a repeatable fashion, making it incredibly powerful for production
use.

Create a file `label-ns-fc.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace
data:
  "label_name": "color"
  "label_value": "orange"
```

This file contains a `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation specifying the
docker image to use for the config as well as a data field containing a
key-value map with the "label_name" and "label_value" arguments specified
earlier. Using a map also makes it easier to pass more complex arguments values
like a list of strings.

Run the function:

```sh
kpt fn run .
```

The example command will:

- read all resources from the package directory `.` to generate input resources
- for each resource with the `config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation, e.g.
  `label-ns-fc.yaml`, KPT will run the specified function (using the resource
  as the functionConfig)
  - functions are run sequentially, with the output of each function provided
    as input to the next
- write the output items back to the package directory `.`

Here, rather than specifying `gcr.io/kpt-functions/label-namespace` using the
`--image` flag, we specify it in a file using the
`config.kubernetes.io/function` annotation.
